    Burning Rubber - Buggy Editor

  <p>
  Click one of the options below to make a new buggy, show your current buggies, get your buggy data to race with, or look at how this was made! 
  </p>

  <div class="spacer">
    <a href="/new" class="button">Make buggy</a>
    <a href="/buggy" class="button">Show buggies</a>
    <a href="/json" class="button">Get buggy JSON</a>
    <a href="/poster" class="button">Go to poster</a>
  </div>

  <p>
    Use this editor to specify a racing buggy. The editor saves it in its
    little database and generates JSON data for the buggy. This is the data you
    need to supply when you log into the
    <strong><a href="{{ server_url }}">race server</a></strong> and enter your
    buggy into the next race.
  </p>
  <p>
    Remember that if your data is not accepted by the race server, your buggy
    will be disqualified from that race... so make sure you program your editor
    correctly.
